# R6 Digital coding test 

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Run `composer install` in the repo directory.
3. Run `vendor\bin\phpunit.bat` (for Windows) or `vendor/bin/phpunit` (for MacOS or Linux) to verify the install has
happened correctly. You should have 1 test pass and 3 tests fail.

(Note: the PHPUnit tests are provided as a convenience, but you are not required to use them. If you're having
trouble getting it set up you can skip steps 2 and 3.)

## Instructions

1. Open `src/AsciiTable.php` and read the instructions for the task.
2. Implement your solution within the `getAsciiTable` function.
3. Once complete, email your `AsciiTable.php` file to your contact at R6.

## Notes

* This task should take 30 minutes to 2 hours to complete.
* There is no specific style guide but your submitted code should be consistent in the style you use.
* If you find yourself unable to get a particular part of your code working, please feel free to provide comments
  or psuedocode instead - we don't want you getting caught up on some trivial part of the code because you don't know
  the exact syntax or function to use. This task is intended to be a general test of your coding abilities only.
